#Diabetes Readmission Predictor
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the probability of hospital readmission within 30
days of discharge for patients with diabetes, based on various factors such as age, gender,
medication, HbA1c levels, and medical and demographic history. The analysis aims to identify
which factors are most strongly associated with hospital readmissions and to develop a
predictive model that can accurately estimate the probability of readmission for individual
patients.
